    <h1> Prelude to the American Revolution </h1>
    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p>
    Before the Seven Years War, also known as the French and Indian War, Great Britain mainly left the thirteen colonies alone. They were:
    <ol>
      <li>Delaware</li>
      <li>Pennsylvania</li>
      <li>New Jersey</li>
      <li>Georgia</li>
      <li>Connecticut</li>
      <li>Massachusetts</li>
      <li>Maryland</li>
      <li>South Carolina</li>
      <li>New Hampshire</li>
      <li>Virginia</li>
      <li>New York</li>
      <li>North Carolina</li>
      <li>Rhode Island</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    So, as I was saying earlier, the British Empire allowed the colonies to govern themselves. That means that the colonies were allowed to create their 
    own laws. They were still loyal to Great Britain. The colonies <strong> flourished </strong> under self-governance. The population boomed since at 
    the time, North America was full of opportunities. Beaver hunting, logging, farming, shipbuilding, and raising livestock were just a few of the 
    opportunities that were there in the colonies. People had lots of freedom in the colonies since they were practically their own country. They had to
    pay some taxes to Great Britain, but other than that, they barely had anything to do with Great Britain. All of this changed after the Seven Years 
    War / French and Indian War.

    <h3>The Seven Years War</h3>
    <p>
    During the Age of Exploration, which was when explorers from different European countries wanted to claim land for their countries, France claimed 
    a majority of Canada while the British claimed the thirteen colonies. The French were moving South while the British were moving West. They met up 
    in the Ohio River Valley. The French established a fort in modern-day Pittsburgh. They called it Fort Duquesne. The British sent George Washington 
    to attack the French. The British and the French met up at The Battle of Jumonville Glen. The British won. Washington reached Fort Duquesne, but 
    this time the French won. The Battle was going heavily in the French favor until 1756. That's when British treasurer, William Bradford Pitt, 
    invested all of England's money to finance the war. The Battle that was the turning point of the war was the Battle of Montreal, in 1759. The 
    British won. 4 years later, the British and the French signed the Treaty of Paris. Great Britain gained all the land East of the Mississippi River. 
    They also gained a lot of Canada. Although the British won the war, they had a war debt of 186,251,100 U.S. Dollars today.
