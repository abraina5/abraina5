    <h1> Prelude to the American Revolution </h1>
    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p class="red">
    Before the Seven Years War, also known as the French and Indian War, Great Britain mainly left the thirteen colonies alone. They were:
    </p>
    <ol class="blue">
      <li>Delaware</li>
      <li>Pennsylvania</li>
      <li>New Jersey</li>
      <li>Georgia</li>
      <li>Connecticut</li>
      <li>Massachusetts</li>
      <li>Maryland</li>
      <li>South Carolina</li>
      <li>New Hampshire</li>
      <li>Virginia</li>
      <li>New York</li>
      <li>North Carolina</li>
      <li>Rhode Island</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="red">
    So, as I was saying earlier, the British Empire allowed the colonies to govern themselves. That means that the colonies were allowed to create their 
    own laws. They were still loyal to Great Britain. The colonies <strong> flourished </strong> under self-governance. The population boomed since at 
    the time, North America was full of opportunities. Beaver hunting, logging, farming, shipbuilding, and raising livestock were just a few of the 
    opportunities that were there in the colonies. People had lots of freedom in the colonies since they were practically their own country. They had to
    pay some taxes to Great Britain, but other than that, they barely had anything to do with Great Britain. All of this changed after the Seven Years 
    War / French and Indian War. 
    </p>
    <h3>The Seven Years War</h3>
    <p class="blue">
    During the Age of Exploration, which was when explorers from different European countries wanted to claim land for their countries, France claimed 
    a majority of Canada while the British claimed the thirteen colonies. The French were moving South while the British were moving West. They met up 
    in the Ohio River Valley. The French established a fort in modern-day Pittsburgh. They called it Fort Duquesne. The British sent George Washington 
    to attack the French. The British and the French met up at The Battle of Jumonville Glen. The British won. Washington reached Fort Duquesne, but 
    this time the French won. The Battle was going heavily in the French favor until 1756. That's when British treasurer, William Bradford Pitt, 
    invested all of England's money to finance the war. The Battle that was the turning point of the war was the Battle of Montreal, in 1759. The 
    British won. 4 years later, the British and the French signed the Treaty of Paris. Great Britain gained all the land East of the Mississippi River. 
    They also gained a lot of Canada. Although the British won the war, they had a war debt of 186,251,100 U.S. Dollars today.
    </p>
    <h2>The Causes of the War</h2>
    <h3>The Proclamation of 1763</h3>
    <p class="red">
    Now that the British had won the Seven Years War, they had 2 major issues. The debt, and native americans. They first decided to deal with the native 
    americans. Parliament drew an imaginary line on the Appalachian Mountains, and stated that the native americans should stay West, and the colonists 
    should stay East.This angered colonists since the population in the colonies was booming. Eventually, immigrants needed to go west. Also, some 
    colonists already had claims to lands in the west, and now their claims were useless. Some defiled Great Britain and crossed over anyway, since 
    Parliament couldnÂ´t enforce it.
    </p>
    <h3>The Stamp Act</h3>
    <p class="blue">
    After the Proclamation of 1763, in 1765, the British made their first effort to collect money that was spent during the French and Indian War. The 
    British Parliament passed the Stamp Act. Anything that was made out of paper had to have a stamp on it. the stamps cost money, and it had to be used 
    for everything. Newspapers, playing cards, certificates, you name it. This angered the colonists since they didn't have any representation in 
    parliament. Colonists began crying "No Taxation Without Representation!" The boycotted British products, so the Stamp Act started turning into a money
    loser. Eventually, parliament repealed the Stamp Act. Colonists all over the colonies started celebrating, but they did a little too early.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="#quartering">The Quartering Act</h3>
    <p class="red">
    After the Stamp Act was repealed, the British passed the Quartering Act. This was a law that stated that if British soldiers came knocking on their
    door, the colonists had to feed them, house them, and gave them "candles, furnishing, beer, or cider." You had to do all of this and they didn't
    have to pay you anything. This was probably the worst of what Great Britain had done to them so far.  and taking care of soldiers cost money. The 
    soldiers could practically live in your house, leaving less for you and your family to eat. Also, the main reason soldiers were sent was to defend
    against Native Americans. If the soldiers were sitting in New York City, then the soldiers would just be taking up space, since there weren't 
    going to be Native American rebellions in the middle of New York City. If anything, they should be in the Appalachian Mountains to enforce the 
    Proclamation of 1763. This was the 3rd step in the colonists road to the fight for independence.
    </p>
    <h3>The Townshend Acts</h3>
    <p class="blue">
    The Townshend Acts were taxes on items such as:
    </p>
    <ul class="red">
      <li>glass</li>
      <li>paper</li>
      <li>tea</li>
      <li>paint</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="blue">
    Again, the colonists were steaming mad. A Boston Patriot named Samuel Adams ordered a boycott of British goods. Sam Adams had a gift of stirring up
    people with his speeches and writings. He was also a member of the Sons of Liberty, a patriot group that was made up of regular people who were 
    fighting for independence. Eventually, all the 13 colonies agreed to be part of the boycott. In 1770, a new person named Lord North took charge. He 
    asked Parliament to repeal the Townshend Acts. By this time, many people could see that because of the boycott, the Townshend acts were turning into
    a money loser. Parliament repealed all taxes except for the tea tax. Some Parliament members also wanted to get rid of the tea tax, but King George 
    was adamant about taxing the colonists. He stated "I am clear that there must always be one tax to keep up the right."
    </p>
    <h3>The Boston Massacre</h3>
    <p class="red">
    On the same day that Parliament repealed the Townshend Acts, a fight broke out between soldiers and colonists in Boston. An angry mob had gathered, 
    and they were yelling insults at the British soldiers. Both Patriot and British leaders tried to get everyone to go back home, but the mob wouldn't 
    part. Eventually, the British fired on colonists killing 5 and injuring 10. The enraged crowd went home only after a promise that there would be a 
    murder trial for the soldiers. During the trial, the British soldiers were defended by none other than John Adams, cousin of Sam Adams and also a 
    member of the Sons of Liberty. Be believed that everyone should be given the right to have a fair trial. He argued that the British were acting out 
    of self-defense. In the end, only 2 of the British soldiers were found guilty
    </p>
    <p class="blue">
    In the meantime, Sam Adams saw this as a chance to whip up anti-British feelings. He called it a massacre, even though only a few people died. A 
    silversmith named Paul Revere made an engraving that shows neatly arranged British soldiers firing upon a helpless crowd.

    <h3>The Boston Tea Party</h3>
    <p class="red">
    As stated earlier, Parliament repealed all taxes except the tea tax. Now, since the British East India company (which was the British tea company)
    was starting to fail, Great Britain chose to give full control of all the tea sold in the colonies to the East India Company. So, the British East 
    India company could raise or lower the price on tea anytime they wished. British Parliament thought of a <strong>"brilliant"</strong> plan. They 
    would make the prices of the British tea so low, that even wit the tax, it cost less money than tea smuggled into the colonies illegally.For 
    example, if the tax was half of the original tea price, and the original tea price was $1, than the overall cost would be $1.50. The illegal tea 
    would be for example, $2. The British thought this was the smartest thing they had ever come up with. Colonists would definitely pay the tax now.
    Only, they were wrong. The colonists saw right through the plan of the British and <strong>still</strong> imported illegal tea, even if it was more 
    expensive.
    </p>
    <p class="blue">
    3 British ships full of tea landed in Boston harbor in 1773. Angry protesters prevented the ships from unloading their tea. On December 16, 1773, 
    Sam Adams and 50 other people in the Sons of Liberty dressed up as Mohawk Indians raided the ships. They dumped all the tea from all the ships into 
    Boston harbor. <strong>90,000 pounds of tea were thrown into Boston harbor in one night.</strong> The colonists only went for the tea, and nothing 
    else on the ship was damaged. But this one act would have severe consequences.
    </p>
    <h2>The Coercive Acts</h2>
    <p class="red">
    The British Parliament and Lord North were shocked! They had given colonists cheaper tea and the colonists threw it right into the ocean! As a 
    response, Parliament passed the Coercive Acts. The acts were so horrendous that the colonists called them the Intolerable Acts, which is the better 
    known name. This is what the Intolerable Acts did:
    <ul class="blue">
      <li>Close Boston Harbor until all the tea was paid for. Since Boston relied on trade to survive, closing the harbor would starve the Bostonians.</li>
      <li>Massachusetts was placed firmly under British control.</li>
      <li>Colonists in Massachusetts could not hold a meeting without approval of the governor. Since the governor was appointed by the king, he would side 
      with the king. This barred groups such as the Sons of Liberty from making plans.</li>
      <li>British soldiers accused of murder would have a trial in Great Britain, not in the colonies. This would give British soldiers a lower chance of 
      being found guilty since they were <strong>British</strong> soldiers. If they had a great reputation in Great Britain, but was actually pretentious, 
      if they actually murdered someone, court would most likely not find them guilty.</li>
      <li>The Quartering Act was reinstated</li>
      <li id="quartering">More British troops would be sent to Boston to enforce these laws</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The First Continental Congress</h3>
    <p class="red">
    The Bostonians refused pay for the tea. They would rather have Boston in flames than pay a single penny from the tea party. Virginians supported 
    Boston, since if the British could do this in Boston, they could do it anywhere. Other colonies began sending supplies to the starving residents of 
    Boston. They also called for the First Continental Congress to meet. It was made up of people from 12 colonies. (Only Georgia didn't send a 
    delegation.) In the end, they sent a letter to King George asking for peace. They also did a boycott to try to make the British repeal the Intolerable 
    Acts. They also formed colonial militias. Militias were small armies made up of volunteers. They called themselves minutemen since they said that they 
    could be ready for a battle within a minute. 
    </p>
    <h2>Lexington and Concord</h3>
    <p class="blue">
    A British spy informed General Gage (the head of the army for the British at the time), that colonists were storing ammunition and weapons in Concord, 
    a city in Massachusetts. Intending to confiscate all the ammunition and weapons, they marched toward Concord via Lexington. They went to Lexington to 
    capture Sam Adams and John Hancock. But, colonials spies informed Paul Revere and William Dawes of the British movements.
    </p>
    <p class="red">
    Paul Revere and William Dawes rode in the middle of the night, on their horses, to alert colonists that the British were coming."The regulars are coming, the regulars are
    coming!" they shouted. Regulars were another name for the British. At the Old North Church, which was the highest point in Boston, Paul Revere hung two 
    lanterns, signifying that the British were coming by water, using the Charles River. They rode throughout the night, eventually reaching Lexington. Adams 
    and Hancock escaped and they headed for Concord. On their way to Concord, they met up with Samuel Prescott, who  assisted them. But on their way to Concord, 
    Revere was eventually captured. He was released since he was slowing the British down and they wouldn't be able to get to Lexington by morning. 
    </p>
    <h3>The Shot Heard Around the World</h3>
    <p class="blue">
    Thanks to Revere, Dawes, and Prescott, the minutemen of Lexington were ready. Nobody knows who fired the first shot. But after that, fighting broke 
    out. In the end, 8 colonists died and none of the British soldiers died. After Lexington, a second group of minutemen met them at Concord. This time, 
    using tactics of guerilla warfare, the colonists won the battle. 74 British soldiers died and 49 colonists died. This was officially the beginning of 
    the American Revolution.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="red">
    Soon after Lexington and Concord, the Continental Congress met again. This time, they drafted the Declaration of Independence, which announced that America was now independent of Great Britain. Washington had lost badly 
    in 1776. But, surprise victories boosted the American morale. In 1778, the colonists won the Battle of Saratoga. This was the turning point in the war. 
    After this victory, the French decided to send soldiers to the United States of America. 3 years later, the Americans surrounded Lord Cornwallis at 
    Yorktown, Virginia. This was it. Even though it took another two years, the 8 years of fighting had the desired result. A new nation, the United States of America.
