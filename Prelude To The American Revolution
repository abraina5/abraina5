    <h1> Prelude to the American Revolution </h1>
    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
    Before the Seven Years War, also known as the French and Indian War, Great Britain mainly left the thirteen colonies alone. They were:
    <ol>
      <li>Delaware</li>
      <li>Pennsylvania</li>
      <li>New Jersey</li>
      <li>Georgia</li>
      <li>Connecticut</li>
      <li>Massachusetts</li>
      <li>Maryland</li>
      <li>South Carolina</li>
      <li>New Hampshire</li>
      <li>Virginia</li>
      <li>New York</li>
      <li>North Carolina</li>
      <li>Rhode Island</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    So, as I was saying earlier, the British Empire allowed the colonies to govern themselves. That means that the colonies were allowed to create their 
    own laws. They were still loyal to Great Britain. The colonies <strong> flourished </strong> under self-governance. The population boomed since at 
    the time, North America was full of opportunities. Beaver hunting, logging, farming, shipbuilding, and raising livestock were just a few of the 
    opportunities that were there in the colonies.
